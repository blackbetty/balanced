		u'body': u'While Donald Trump may have become president-elect because of the Electoral College, not all of the individual electors are going to accept his victory there without protest.\n\nAs The Denver Post reported on Wednesday, a group of electoral college voters from Colorado have dubbed themselves the "Hamilton Electors" and filed paperwork on Tuesday with the Colorado Secretary of State to create a "527" group, which will allow them to raise unlimited donations from individuals, corporations, and labor unions. Their goal is to convince as many Republican electors as possible to defect from Trump; if enough are swayed to do this, they would either cause a deadlock in the Electoral College (throwing the election into the House of Representatives) or result in the election of an entirely different candidate.\n\n"I was opposed, actually, to raising money because I would prefer to just have this done organically," said Michael Baca, the Colorado Democratic elector who filed the 527 paperwork, in an interview with The Denver Post. "But we\'ve had people throwing money at us through our website."\n\nIn order for the movement to be successful, however, it will need to convince 37 Republican electors to abandon Trump for either Hillary Clinton or a third-party candidate -- enough to push Trump\'s total number under 270, which is the threshold he must pass in order to legally become president. Similarly, it could achieve something of a symbolic victory by convincing as many Democratic electors as possible to abandon Clinton and instead register a protest vote by submitting a ballot for a moderate Republican.\n\nBecause 29 states have laws binding electors to the candidate who won the most votes in their state, however, it is very unlikely that the Hamilton Electors will achieve more than a handful of symbolic victories.\n\nEven worse for Baca, he has only had success with roughly half-a-dozen electors so far, including four Democrats in Colorado and at least two in Washington. He also claimed to have received a commitment from one anonymous Republican and is in talks with four others, leading him to suggest that "we might just roll out a press conference with five Republicans."',
